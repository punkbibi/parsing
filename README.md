# Steam Charts and Garry's Mods Scraper



Welcome to the Steam Charts and Garry's Mods Scraper! This Python script allows you to explore and gather data from two popular gaming websites: [Steam Charts](https://steamcharts.com/) and [Garry's Mods](https://garrysmods.org/).

## Features

- **Steam Charts Scraper**: This script retrieves data about the top games on Steam and their peak player counts. It scrapes multiple pages of Steam Charts to provide you with a comprehensive list of popular games.

- **Garry's Mods Scraper**: With this script, you can collect information about the most downloaded maps on Garry's Mods. It scrapes multiple pages of Garry's Mods to give you insights into the trending maps.

- **Data Storage**: The scraped data is saved in CSV files for easy analysis and integration with other tools. You can find two CSV files generated by the script: `steam_charts.csv` and `maps.csv`. These files contain the names and relevant statistics for the top games and maps, respectively.

- **HTML Response Capture**: In addition to CSV files, the script also saves the HTML responses of each page scraped. This feature allows you to explore the raw HTML and gain a deeper understanding of the data.
